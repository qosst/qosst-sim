        show that the covariance matrix of the entenglement-based version of the
        protocol can be safely replaced by a gaussian state matrix of the form :

            Gamma = [[ V * Id_2       Z * sigma_z ]
                     [ Z * sigma_z    W * Id_2    ]]


            when computing the secret key rate.

        The scalar parameters V := 1/2(<x_A**2> + <p_A**2>) = 1 + 2*<N_A>
                              W := 1/2(<x_B**2> + <p_B**2>) = 1 + 2*<N_B>

        can be estimated easily, and one need their upper bounds to compute the
        Holevo bound. As for  Z := 1/4(<x_A , x_B> + <p_A, p_B>) = <a*b + a_dag*b_dag>

        one needs a lower bound on this quantity, which is very difficult to
        precisely estimante. A bound is given by the Denys-Brown-Leverrier bound
        Z_star defined above.
